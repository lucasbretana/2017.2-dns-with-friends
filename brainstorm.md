# Server side ideias
The launcher prepares the server with the operation options set the defaults one. All options can be set my parameter.
But before really start the server the aplication show the options and asks if it's all good, or to change.
If it is the case to change something, go to a step by step y/N questions to change the configurtions.
Using the already confirmed configurations, start the server on another thread, and listen to commands on main thread, that will the server things.


Possible manual commands:
 - /override : any request must be manually answered (implement fisrt)
 - /kill : pretty obvious
 - /restart : ...we are getting pretty down on the imagination area...
